# Voice AI Runtime

A low-level real-time conversational AI runtime built using Python, C shared libraries, Whisper, Ollama, and Piper TTS.

This project focuses on:
- realtime audio pipelines
- event-driven runtime architecture
- streaming AI responses
- interruptible TTS
- low-level systems programming concepts
- multithreaded conversational runtimes

# Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anchit3034/voicis.git
cd voice_ai
```

---

# Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

# Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install \
libpulse-dev \
ffmpeg \
python3-pyaudio \
portaudio19-dev
```

---

# Compile Audio Engine

-lpulse-simple \
-lpulse
```

---

# Setup Ollama

Install Ollama:

[https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)

Pull model:

```bash
ollama pull tinyllama
```

Run server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

---

# Setup Piper

Download Piper:

[https://github.com/rhasspy/piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)

Place:

* `piper`
* `en_US-lessac-medium.onnx`

inside:

```text
piper/
```

---

# Run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

---

# Controls

```text
ENTER  → Start / Stop Recording
q      → Quit Runtime
Ctrl+C → Force Shutdown
```

---

# Current Status

Current runtime supports:

* realtime transcription
* streaming LLM responses
* interruptible TTS
* multithreaded pipeline execution

This is still an experimental runtime and not production-ready.

---

# Future Improvements

* Full duplex conversation
* Better interruption handling
* Streaming Whisper inference
* Adaptive VAD
* Echo cancellation
* GPU scheduling
* WebSocket runtime
* Runtime metrics dashboard
* SIMD audio preprocessing
* RNNoise integration
* Wake-word activation
* Better memory/context handling
* Lower latency streaming

---

# Known Issues

* Whisper latency on CPU
* Audio quality depends heavily on microphone quality
* TTS interruption can still race under heavy load
* PulseAudio introduces some latency
* Runtime not optimized for long sessions yet

---

# Learning Goals

This project was built to explore:

* low-level runtime systems
* realtime AI pipelines
* concurrent architecture
* Linux audio systems
* streaming inference systems
* conversational runtime engineering
